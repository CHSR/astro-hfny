              Healthy Families New York is a program to help parents with the
              changes and needs of their family that come along with the birth
              of a new child. HFNY offers services to expecting parents and new
              families, beginning weekly and decreasing over time, until the
              child starts school or Head Start. Services are available in
              English and other languages, depending on the program serving each
              community.
