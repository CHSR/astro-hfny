            <p>
              Healthy Families New York, a Healthy Families America accredited
              home visiting program, seeks to improve the health and well-being
              of infants and children through home-based services delivered by
              non-profit organizations in local communities. The program was
              established in 1995 by the New York State Office of Children and
              Family Services. It is an evidence-based voluntary home visiting
              model designed to provide services to families that begin
              prenatally, or at birth, through age five.

              they are provided personalized referrals that meet their familyâ€™s
              needs and goals. Additional services may include: providing
              information about parenting, infant and child development, and
              child health; connecting families with medical providers for
              prenatal/well-baby visits and immunizations; assessing children
              for developmental delays; and helping families access community

              <h3>Child Welfare Protocol</h3>
              Several HFNY programs offer extended eligibility for families referred
              from child welfare agencies. Programs offering the Healthy Families
              America Child Welfare Protocol can offer services to families who are
              pregnant or have at least one child under 24 months of age when the
              referral comes directly from child welfare. Families DO NOT have to
              have an open investigation or preventive services case to be referred.

              Home visitors can inform expectant and new parents about the
              benefits of prenatal care and well-baby visits, and assist them in
              making and keeping appointments. They can answer questions about
              child development and help parents maintain a safe and supportive
              environment for their family. Research from a randomized
              controlled trial shows that Healthy Families New York works for a
              diverse array of families, including first-time teen parents and
              those who have had experience with the child welfare system.
              Specifically, research shows that Healthy Families New York:
              <ul>
                <li>Improves birth outcomes</li>
                <li>Promotes success in school</li>
